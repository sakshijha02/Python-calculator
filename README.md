In this python code of calculator i use
input function which is used to take input from user.
after that i use if else and elif condition statement 
which allows your program to do different things
based on different condition  
i know this is very simple calculator but 
this is my first ever calculator 
and from this calculator code i learn various 
concept which will use in future.
